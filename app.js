// HINTS
// IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS AT ONCE:
// For each question, create a container for wrapping it; then create a radio button
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio
// with, as options, both the correct answer and the incorrect ones
// (you'll probably need to google how to get the value from a radio button in JS to evaluate the final score)
//
// IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
// Display the first question with the text and the radio buttons
// when the user selects an answer, pick the next question from the array and replace the old one with it
// saving the user's choice in a variable

// How to calculate the result? You can do it in 2 ways:
// If you are presenting all the questions together, just take all the radio buttons and check if the selected answer === correct_answer
// If you are presenting one question at a time, just add one point or not to the user score if the selected answer === correct_answer
